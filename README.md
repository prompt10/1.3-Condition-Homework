# 1.3-Condition-Homework
It's me, the wannabe.
You might ask why don't I use Windows Form, there's a reason
First, Using mouse to point and click is pretty non-precise in stock trading. Imagine holding because you think the price is 0.2 more it actually is, couldn't be me.
Second, The unit of time and price can be absurdly high in some case. I believe no one want to ruin their mouse wheel so they can just zoom out.
Lastly, I gave up trying using Windows Form. This one is the most important, but the first 2 is more chivalrous, that's all.
